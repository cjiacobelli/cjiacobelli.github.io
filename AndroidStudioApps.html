								<h2>Background</h2>
								<p>This past summer, I decided to learn how to make apps in android studio using online resources. My goal was to learn to create an app similar to Instagram. Completing this project taught me how to code in Kotlin, Java and XML. Additionally, it taught me how to use Google Firebase as the backend of the app to store all the data.</p>
							
								<h2>The App</h2>
								<p>The app shares many of the same features as popular social media platforms. Such features include the posting and sharing of content, including images and videos, through individual accounts .  Additionally, each user can recover their password through a verified email, change their password or username.  Accounts also have the ability to add the links to their other social medias. Furthermore, users may delete or report posts, as well as change a post's caption.</p>

								<p>Once logged in, there are five pages; explore, top posts, profile, new posts and settings. The explore page compares two randomized posts, that are not your own, to be voted on using buttons at the bottom of the display. Once a vote is made, the upvote is added to the chosen post and then refreshes to new randomly generated content. The top posts page is an infinite scroll that displays every post based on its popularity, measured in upvotes. The profile page shows all of your posts and has options for you to delete and edit content. The settings page allows you to change your username or password, and logout. The new post page is where you create and upload your posts.</p>
