								<h2>Background</h2>
								<p>This past summer, I worked as an engineering intern for INTGR8 Technologies. One of the projects required me to work on android studio code with data from a map SDK and integrate the MapBox Vision SDK into it.  This helped me improve my Java, Kotlin and XML skills as well as taught me to parse large HTML code files.</p>
								<h2>The Project</h2>
								<p>The goal of the project was to create an app that could establish speed limits by reading the road signs via its camera. If there weren’t any signs, the app would be able to use its GPS and internet connection to call a speed limit using a map SDK.  Finding the speed limit through a map SDK was completed by first, accessing the device’s coordinates.  The speed limit layer of the map was then found by using a link that led to HTML code, which had to be parsed to access information such as the street name and speed limits.
									<br /><br />The MapBox vision SDK aspect of the project was not entirely completed in the time I was working on it.  Most of the code was in place however.   None of the code is available for viewing as it is private in GitHub and property of INTGR8 Technologies.
